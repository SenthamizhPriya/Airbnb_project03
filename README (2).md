# Airbnb Data Analysis




## Project overview

This project involves analyzing Airbnb listings data to provide insights into price variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. The analysis is conducted using Python for data processing and Streamlit for creating an interactive web application.
## Technologies Used

- Python: Data cleaning, processing, and analysis.
- Streamlit: Interactive web application development.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: Numerical operations.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Static data visualization.
- Plotly: Interactive data visualization.

## How to Set Up and Run the Project

To get this application up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

- Prerequisites
Python installed on your computer.
Access to the Internet to install dependencies.


- Installation
Install required Python libraries

- Cloning repository

- Preparing the Dataset
Ensure your Airbnb dataset is available in the specified directory or update the data loading path in the code.

- Running the Application
To run the app, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and type:
streamlit run airbnb_streamlit.py
This will start the Streamlit application, and it should be accessible via a web browser at localhost:8501.


## Usage

- Access the Streamlit app via your local server.
- Use the interactive maps and visualizations to explore Airbnb listings, prices, availability, and location-based insights.

## Features of the app include:

- Interactive maps showing the distribution of Airbnb listings.
- Price analysis and visualizations based on location and property types.
- Availability patterns analysis across different seasons.
- Location-based insights with data for specific regions or neighborhoods.
- Interactive visualizations allowing users to filter and drill down into the data.
